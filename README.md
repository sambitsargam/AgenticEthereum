# AgentLink: Bridging Blockchain with SMS and WhatsApp Messaging

## Overview

AgentLink is an innovative SMS and WhatsApp messaging agent built on Base Chain. It empowers users to perform on-chain transactions, send funds, deploy and mint NFTs, and even create and manage smart contracts—all through simple text-based communication. This approach bridges the gap between advanced blockchain functionalities and mainstream communication platforms.

## Why AgentLink?

Most AI-powered bots are built on platforms like Telegram, leaving out a significant global user base that relies on WhatsApp or SMS for primary communication. In many regions, people are unaware of Telegram but actively use WhatsApp and SMS. Additionally, SMS works efficiently in areas with low internet connectivity, making blockchain accessible to underconnected regions.

## Reason Behind Building AgentLink

The inspiration for AgentLink came from a profound realization: **blockchain technology should be universally accessible, regardless of internet quality or platform familiarity.**

- **Digital Inclusion**: By integrating blockchain with common messaging services, AgentLink levels the playing field, bringing decentralized finance (DeFi) to underserved populations.
- **Seamless Adoption**: Using familiar tools ensures minimal learning curves, accelerating blockchain adoption.
- **Resilience**: Even in areas with unstable internet, SMS ensures uninterrupted communication, making on-chain transactions more reliable.

## Key Features
